Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

With the script in run_analysis.R the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone can be downloaded to your working directory. Then, you must unzip the data in your working directory. Their internal directories are acessed by the code for each file that is read.

In order to make it easier for data analysis the name of the variables for each measurement was changed to "measureX.type", where "X" represents a index for one of the measurements and "type" the type of a descriptive estimative from the measurement (mean or standard deviation). The file CodeBook.xlsx shows the complete scenario.
